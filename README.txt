This section is a skeleton code of sorts writen for the entire project.
Any parts that would require interaction with the hardware are simply print statements in this version
sections of this code may not correspond with a user story because the user stories are more centered around the hardware
at least 30%(probably more) of the code is contained here.


To run and test this project, run "UserInterface.cpp" and procede as if you are a user 

to test a specific user story run the cases below

cd /media/sf_3307VMshared/CS-3307/Group_Project/group28

1. YOLO

2. Shoot Your Shoot

3. PourDrink

4. User Interface

Run this, and enjoy! 

g++ Liquid.cpp Drink.cpp DrinkFactory.cpp Menu.cpp Pump.cpp GPIOpin.cpp SYS.cpp YOLO.cpp UserInterface.cpp

To run ./a.out 

:)

Ben, Jodi, Justin, Shawn, Connor
