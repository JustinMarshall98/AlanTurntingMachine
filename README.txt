There has been alot of time and effort put into setting up the hardware for this project. 
We obviously cannot submit the hardware online but will present it when we present our project.

to compile:

g++ Liquid.cpp Drink.cpp DrinkFactory.cpp Menu.cpp Pump.cpp GPIOpin.cpp SYS.cpp YOLO.cpp UserInterface.cpp

To run:

./a.out 

:) 

Sincerely, 
Ben, Jodi, Justin, Shawn, Connor
